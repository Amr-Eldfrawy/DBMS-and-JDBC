this file holds the assumption that all of us should build his code relative to it

***** the queries :
1- create database database_name
2- create table table_name from database_name column_name column_type column_name column_type
3- insert into table_name from database_name column_name data_1 column_name data_2
4- select from table_name from database_name condition
5- delete from table_name from database_name condition
6- update from table_name from database_name condition data

* for number 2&3 to entering undefined number of columns
* omar is going to define class condition and condition will be a type that any one can use it not to change it

***** Data types that we will support
1 - integer
2 - string
3 - double

*****linking between validation and the DBMS_Interface senario 
ex :
the statement "create database AlexFOE"
after validation senario (it is valid of course !)
i will have a DBMS object say DMBS_Object = new DBMS();
then i will call DBMS_Object.creat_Database("AlexFOE");
and the critical case will till now as i think 
 a) number 3 in the queries 
 		DBMS_Object.insert_Into_Table(database_name,table_name,data[])
 		data[i] = pair_data
 		there will be getters to read from pair_data

******** Condition is class holds 3 members data_1 -> column , operator, data_2 -> data
i will send to dbms this condition as an object condition then the DBMS will evaluate it
